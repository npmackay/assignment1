"It was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing," he said. 
"This is going to sound funny and a little strange, but you were in a dream I had just a couple of days ago.
I'd love to get together and tell you about it if you're up for a cup of coffee," he continued, 
laying the trap he'd been planning for years.
Was it a whisper or was it the wind? He wasn't quite sure. 
He thought he heard a voice but at this moment all he could hear was the wind rustling the leaves of the trees all around him.
He stopped and listened more intently to see if he could hear the voice again.
Nothing but the wind rustling the leaves could be heard. He was about to continue his walk when he felt a hand on his shoulder,
and he quickly turned to see who it was. There was nobody there, but he heard the voice again.
One foot in front of the other, One more step, and then one more.
Jack's only thoughts were to keep moving no matter how much his body screamed to stop and rest. 
He's lost almost all his energy and his entire body ached beyond belief, 
but he forced himself to take another step. Then another. And then one more.
There was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming.
In his youth, he sought adventure and the unknown, but that had been years ago. 
He wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless.
That curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone.
Should he write it down? That was the question running through his mind.
He couldn't believe what had just happened and he knew nobody else would believe him as well. 
Even if he documented what had happened by writing it down, he still didn't believe anyone would still believe it. 
So the question remained. Was it be worth it to actually write it down?
